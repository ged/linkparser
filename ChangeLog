    * Updated the binding to build against 4.3.9.
    * Removed the necessity of building against a patched link-grammar library. Removed the stuff
    from the patch that was no longer necessary since 4.3.9 now include the necessary
    memory-freeing functions, and no longer printf()s warnings without adhering to the warning
    level.
    * Updated the build system.
    * Still needs more work before it can be gemmed up, but it's close.
    * Thanks, as always, to Martin Chase for many useful suggestions and help.
