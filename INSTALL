These instructions assume a UNIX or UNIX-like environment. I've built it on
MacOS X, FreeBSD 7.x, and Ubuntu Linux. I'm not sure how to get this to build
under Windows, as I don't have a Windows license with which to test it.
Suggestions welcomed.

First, you'll need the 'mkrf' library to build the C extension if you don't
already have it installed. If you use Rubygems, it should be as simple as:

    $ sudo gem install mkrf

Once you have that installed, patch and install the Abiword link-grammar
library that comes with this source (or download it yourself if you wish):

    $ tar -xvzf link-grammar-4.3.9.tar.gz
    $ cd link-grammar-4.3.9
    
    # If you want the LinkParser::Linkage#current_sublinkage method to work, you
    # must apply the included patch. If you don't care about that method, you
    # can skip the next step:
    
    $ patch -p1 < ../link-grammar-4.3.9.patch
    $ ./configure; make; sudo make install
    $ cd ..

Now build, test, and install the Ruby library:

    $ rake
    $ sudo rake install

That's it!
