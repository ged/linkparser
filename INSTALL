These instructions assume a UNIX or UNIX-like environment. I'm not sure how to get 
this to build under Windows. Suggestions welcomed.

First, you'll need the 'mkrf' library to build the C extension if you don't already 
have it installed. If you use Rubygems, it should be as simple as:

  $ sudo gem install mkrf

Once you have that installed, patch and install the Abiword link-grammar library 
that comes with this source (or download it yourself if you wish):

  $ tar -xvzf link-grammar-4.3.5.tar.gz
  $ cd link-grammar-4.3.5
  $ patch -p1 < ../link-grammar-4.3.5.patch
  $ ./configure; make; sudo make install
  $ cd ..

Now build, test, and install the Ruby library:

  $ rake
  $ sudo rake install

That's it!
