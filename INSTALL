These instructions assume a UNIX or UNIX-like environment. I've built it on
MacOS X, FreeBSD 7.x, and Ubuntu Linux. I'm not sure how to get this to build
under Windows, as I don't have a Windows license with which to test it.
Suggestions welcomed.

First, you'll need to install the Abiword link-grammar library that comes with
this source (or download it yourself if you wish):

    $ tar -xvzf link-grammar-4.6.5.tar.gz
    $ cd link-grammar-4.6.5
    $ ./configure; make; sudo make install
    $ cd ..

Now build, test, and install the Ruby library:

    $ rake
    $ sudo rake install

If you've installed the link-grammar library someplace that isn't in your
regular include path, you might have to tell the build system where to look:

    $ rake -- --with-link-grammar-dir=/usr/local

Under MacOS X, unless you've taken extra steps to compile the link-grammar
library as a universal binary, you'll probably also have to limit it to
your machine's architecture:

    $ ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" rake -- --with-link-grammar-dir=/usr/local

That's it!
