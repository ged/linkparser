    => #<LinkParser::Sentence:0x1fe69761a146 "LEFT-WALL people.p use.v Ruby.f
        for.p all.a kinds.n of   nifty.a things.n . RIGHT-WALL"/15

## Installation

First, download and install the latest version of the link-grammar
library from
[Abiword's site](http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/#download).

Then install the gem:

    gem install linkparser

You may need to specify the path to the link-grammar library if you
installed it somewhere that your linker doesn't look by default:

    gem install linkparser -- --with-link-grammar=/usr/local
