== Description

This module is a Ruby binding for 
{the Abiword version}[http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/] of CMU's
{Link Grammar}[http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/], a syntactic parser of English.


=== Example Usage

	require 'linkparser'
	
	dict = LinkParser::Dictionary.new( :screen_width => 100 )
	sent = dict.parse( "People use Ruby for all kinds of nifty things." )
	# => #<LinkParser::Sentence:0xcf8eb "LEFT-WALL people use Ruby for all kinds
	#      of nifty things . RIGHT-WALL"/2 linkages/0 nulls>
	
	sent.subject        # => "people"
	sent.verb           # => "use"
	sent.object         # => "Ruby"
	
	puts sent.constituent_tree_string
	# =>
	# (S (NP People)
	#    (VP use
	#        (NP Ruby)
	#        (PP for
	#            (NP (NP all kinds)
	#                (PP of
	#                    (NP nifty things)))))
	#    .)
	
	puts sent.diagram
	# =>
	#     +-------------------------------Xp------------------------------+
	#     |                +----MVp---+----Jp----+     +------Jp-----+    |
	#     +----Wd---+--Sp--+--Os-+    |    +-Dmc-+--Mp-+    +----A---+    |

== Installation

First, download and install the latest version of the link-grammar 
library from 
{Abiword's site}[http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/#download].

Then install the gem:

    gem install linkparser

You may need to specify the path to the link-grammar library if you 
installed it somewhere that your linker doesn't look by default:

    gem install linkparser -- --with-link-grammar=/usr/local
